  THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
  At the start of your stay you’ll board the yacht at a jetty in Sydney's east (about ten minutes from the city centre and half an hour from the airport). We’ll then take you to a mooring in the harbour for the night - either in nearby Elizabeth Bay or at a more sheltered bay, typically the one just next to Taronga Zoo. If you're staying in the bay next to Taronga Zoo, you'll be surrounded by a National Park, you can enjoy a swim to the nearby beach, and you'll the sun setting over the Harbour Bridge and Opera House.
  
  If you've chosen to stay the night in Elizabeth Bay (for which there's no extra cost on top of what you pay via airbnb) you'll be just a few hundred metres from the jetty where you'll be picked up from. While the mooring in Elizabeth Bay is perfectly safe please be aware that Elizabeth Bay can be exposed to the wind, you won't have a view of the Harbour Bridge or Opera House, you'll be surrounded by other boats that are permanently parked there, and it's not advisable to swim there.
  
  Your skipper will leave you at your mooring for the night (so don’t forget to bring some food and wine or beer!). On the morning of your departure after you’ve had breakfast (and, if you're at Taronga Zoo, another swim!), your skipper will come out to get you and bring you back to the jetty where you boarded.
  
  The Taronga Zoo option costs an additional $200 to cover the time it takes to get to and from there. You can easily combine your staying overnight on the yacht with a private, guided tour cruising round the harbour. Please see 'HARBOUR TOUR' below.
  
  PRIVATE HARBOUR TOUR
  We’d be delighted to take you for a private two hour guided tour around the harbour, under the Harbour Bridge, past the Sydney Opera House and past the exclusive and very expensive houses in the Eastern Suburbs. Even for Sydneysiders who think they know their own city, we guarantee we'll be able to tell you plenty of stories that you never knew about your own city! The private two hour harbour cruise costs $200 but if you combine the cruise with staying the night at Taronga, the cruise will cost you just $100 (i.e. the Taronga option + the Cruise will cost $300, rather than $400). For those who'd like a daytime Harbour Cruise only for up to ten passengers (but not stay the night) please see the bottom of this section for pricing details.
  
  WHAT’S ON BOARD
  Your beds will be made up with luxury linen, blankets, pillows and duvets and we’ll supply fluffy towels, face cloths, soaps etc. The kitchen (galley) has a two burner cooker and oven, a small fridge and plenty of wine glasses, champagne glasses, crockery, cutlery and pots and pans. There's plenty of fresh drinking water on board and we’ll also leave you with cooking basics like salt, pepper, tea, coffee, fresh milk etc and a welcome bowl of snacks. The yacht has two bathrooms with hot showers and whisper quiet electric toilets. There’s also a hot shower at the back of the boat once you’ve been for a swim. In the saloon there’s USB charging for your phones, a Bose stereo system (with Aux input for your phone) and a DVD player with a stack of DVDs to choose from. On deck there’s a huge awning to keep you cool, and a table for dining outside.
  
  ABOUT THE YACHT
  “Europa” is a Wauquiez Centurion C45S. She’s 46 feet (14m) of hand made European luxury and she’s been built to the highest quality. She cost a little under $1m and she’s considerably larger (and a class above) the kinds of yachts that you may find with commercial charter fleets. If you look at the photos you'll see she's more of a Bentley than the boat version of a Hyundai you might be able to rent elsewhere!
  
  WILL I HAVE FUN?
  Yes! The Sydney Morning Herald published a list of the eight “most amazing places to stay” in the whole of Australia – and, I’m very proud to say, we were #3 on the list! If you’re still unsure about how spectacular it is to stay on a luxury yacht in Sydney Harbour, please read the 250+ reviews we’ve received.
  
  WHAT TO BRING
  Once you're on board, getting off the yacht isn't easy so you’ll need to bring with you some food for dinner and breakfast, some drinks (there’s plenty of drinking water on board but please do bring wine, beer, soft drinks etc), your swimming costume, some relaxing reading material – and of course, your camera! There's a supermarket and shopping centre at Edgecliff, 1200m away from where you'll be boarding the yacht.
  
  WHAT NOT TO BRING!
  For reasons of space - and to prevent damage to the teak woodwork on board - please limit your bags to one soft bag per person (plus your food and drink) and please wear soft-soled (non marking) shoes. Work shoes and heels are strictly forbidden. You must not bring eskies (cooler boxes) or suitcases because they can damage the woodwork - if you arrive with suitcases you will not be able to board until you've found somewhere else to store them (if you have a rental car that's the easiest place to store them). If storing luggage is going to be a problem please contact me well in advance and we'll see what we can arrange.
  
  WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?
  The yacht is magic for two people, very comfortable for four people but, while there are three double beds, you’ll find that six people is a bit of a squeeze. You might like to think of it as ‘glamping’ – ie glamourous camping – and although Europa is truly luxurious, she is, after all, a yacht not a hotel! Please also bear in mind that there is no 240V (mains) power on board.
  
  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
  • Do I need a boating licence or boating experience?
  Not at all – a skipper will drive the yacht for you and when the yacht’s on a mooring for the night he’ll leave you there and you’ll be perfectly safe on your own.
  
  • Can I hire the yacht for a tour during the day?
  Of course! The yacht can take up to 10 passengers for day trips and we can either take you for a tour of the harbour or drop anchor in a quiet bay so you can have lunch, drinks and a swim. Please feel free to bring whatever drinks and food you like. Two hour cruise/tours (without staying overnight) cost $500 Mon-Fri, and $600 Sat-Sun and holidays. Additional time costs $100 per hour.
  
  • What are the check-in and check-out times?
  Arrival times for overnight stays are typically at 4pm and we’ll have you back on dry land before 10am. If you’d like to extend your stay (or if you'll be arriving after 4pm) please contact me.
  
  • Where will the boat be moored for an overnight stay?
  You can choose either Elizabeth Bay or a sheltered bay next to Taronga Zoo. (Please note that the exact location where you'll be moored for the night may depend on the weather). At Taronga you’ll have a view of the Opera House, the city lights and the Harbour Bridge, you’ll be surrounded by a National Park, it’s safe to swim there and you can even paddle ashore in the dinghy to catch a ferry into the city. There is an extra cost for staying at Taronga (or some other sheltered bay) - please see ‘Optional Extras’ below. Staying at Elizabeth Bay is included within the Airbnb price but please note that swimming there isn’t recommended, it isn't protected from the weather, and you won’t have a view of the Bridge or Opera House.
  
  • I have a boat licence – can I drive the boat myself?
  Yes, you can certainly drive the boat - but we’ll still provide a skipper to make sure everything's safe. Of course, once the boat is on a mooring the skipper will leave you, but the boat must stay on the mooring - you won’t be able to drive her away!
  
  • Is there wifi on board?
  Yes but... it's only 3G (mobile/cellular) so it's slow and it's limited to 500MB per day so you can't download or stream. If you have your own Australian sim card you'll be able to receive 4G and your internet speed will be 10x faster than the onboard wifi.
  
  • Can we get off the boat?
  Swimming from the boat (when it’s moored near Taronga Zoo) is highly recommended! If you’re staying just one night you’ll probably enjoy every minute of being on the yacht and going for swims but please do bear in mind that getting onto dry land isn't straightforward: if you do want to be able to get off the boat (for instance to go into town) it's best if you contact me to make arrangements. The easiest way, if you’re staying at Taronga, is to use the two-person dinghy to row 50 metres or so to the beach and from there you can catch a regular ferry into town. If you’re staying at Elizabeth Bay the only way to get off the boat is by water taxi (but please be warned: water taxi fares typically start at $120 each way).
  
  • Can we get picked up or dropped off at different wharves around the harbour?
  Of course! Although the regular pick-up and drop-off point is a jetty in Sydney's Darling Point, please enquire if you'd like to be picked up elsewhere and we’ll see what we can organise for you. For instance, you may want to be dropped off at the Opera House, Rose Bay or Watsons Bay so you can have dinner and then be picked up later in the evening.
  
  • Is there parking nearby?
  Yes – there’s free and untimed parking along New Beach Road, near the jetty where you'll board the yacht but if those spaces are taken there are plenty more spaces on Darling Point Rd about 500m away.
  
  • Is there a supermarket nearby?
  Yes, there are Coles and Aldi supermarkets in the shopping centre at Edgecliff, about 1200m (three quarters of a mile) from the wharf. Of course you'll need to go to the shops BEFORE you arrive at the wharf to board the yacht.
  
  • Will staying on the yacht be safe?
  Absolutely! Unlike many other boats listed on Airbnb which are not commercially licensed and are therefore illegal, Europa is equipped and certified as a commercial vessel. That means she has all the safety equipment you can imagine and the yacht is rigourously tested each year to ensure that she’s completely safe. In addition to this (and unlike the owners or operators of many other boats on Airbnb), I'm an approved Master 5 commercial captain which is a requirement for commercial vessels (I'm also an RYA Yachtmaster Instructor!) so you’ll be in very good hands.
  
  • Will we be comfortable?
  The yacht is wonderfully comfortable and, being 46' (14m) long the volume inside is more than twice the volume of the 34' yachts you may find elsewhere. But please do bear in mind that it is a yacht, not an apartment and space is, of course, limited. There's 6'6" of headroom (approx 2m) and the beds are nice and long, but they are a little narrower than the beds you'd have at home. Being on a yacht also needs a degree of physical adeptness so if you don't feel comfortable climbing a 4 ft step ladder (about 1.5m), or if you have trouble getting through the narrow doors of an aircraft toilet then staying on a yacht may not be for you. Please also bear in mind that the boat is on water and it will move (for instance whenever a ferry goes past or, if you're moored in Elizabeth Bay, on a windy night). While 99% of my guests are absolutely fine with the boat's gentle (and very soothing) movement, if you're the kind of person who feels queasy just looking at boats, then please don't make a booking.
  
  • What about the weather?
  Sydney has glorious weather but yes, it does sometimes rain in Sydney! Don't worry, though because the yacht has a huge awning to keep you dry and there's nothing better than sitting back, seeing the elements at their most raw, and watching rain fall hypnotically onto water. And no need to worry if it's windy - I can always find a bay that's wonderfully sheltered.
  
  • What are the costs of tours etc and how do I pay?
  ‘Optional Extras’ are in addition to the accommodation costs paid via airbnb. We ask you, please, to pay for any of these extras in cash before you leave the yacht.
  
  OPTIONAL EXTRAS (for overnight stays - payable in cash before you leave the yacht) 
  • Being taken across the harbour to stay in a quiet bay next to Taronga Zoo (or some other sheltered bay, depending on wind direction): $200
  • Two hour guided private harbour cruise: $200
  • Two hour guided private cruise plus staying next to Taronga Zoo (or some other sheltered bay): $300 (valid when the cruise is taken at the start or end of your stay)
  • Early arrival (prior to 4pm) or late departure (after 10am): $150 (Mon-Thu), $250 (Fri-Sun and public holidays) subject to availability.
  • Hire of 2 person inflatable rowing dinghy (the dinghy is ideal for getting from the yacht to the beach at Taronga Zoo from where you can catch a ferry to the city): $50 for the duration of your stay.
  
  DAY CRUISES/TOURS/HIRE OF YACHT (without staying overnight)
  • With a two hour cruise you'll have a guided tour around the entire harbour: under the Bridge, into Darling Harbour, past the Opera House, Fort Denison and the Naval base, past the expensive real estate in the Eastern Suburbs and up towards Nielsen Park and Watsons Bay. Two hour cruises cost $500 on weekdays and $600 on weekends (Fri-Sun) and public holidays. Up to ten passengers - please do bring whatever food, drinks and alcohol you want. Departures typically any time after 10.30am and return to shore any time before 3pm. 
  • A three hour guided harbour cruise is as above but the extra hour allows time to drop anchor in a sheltered bay for drinks, lunch and a swim (alternatively you can skip the tour round the harbour and instead head straight to a sheltered bay - entirely up to you). Three hour cruises cost $600 on weekdays and $700 on weekends and public holidays. Additional time beyond the three hours is charged at $100 per hour.
  
  Guest access
  
  You'll have complete access to everything on the yacht (kitchen, bathrooms, stereo, wifi, DVDs etc). You won’t be able to drive the yacht on your own without a skipper being on board.
  
  Interaction with guests
  
  I will be available by phone and email throughout the stay to ensure your comfort and safety, and to answer the myriad questions about living on board a yacht!
  
  Other things to note
  
  Do please bear in mind that if you want to get off the boat during your stay (other than swimming to the beach!) it needs some organising and may involve a water taxi (see below regarding the 'Neighbourhood' and 'Getting Around'.
  
  I can help you with details - please let me know what you'd like to do and I'll talk you through the easiest way of doing it!
  
  Please also remember to bring some food with you for the evening and the following morning.`
